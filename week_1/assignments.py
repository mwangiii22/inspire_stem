# this is a progrom to perform arithmetic operations to obtain the sum of 10 numbers of choice and also the average of the 10 numbers.

first_number = 10
second_number = 20
third_number = 30
fourth_number = 40
fifth_number = 50
sixth_number = 60
seventh_number = 70
eighth_number = 80
ninth_number = 90
tenth_number = 100

sum_numbers = first_number + second_number + third_number + fourth_number + fifth_number + sixth_number + seventh_number + eighth_number + ninth_number + tenth_number
average_numbers = sum_numbers / 10
